//1. Difference between a parameter and an argument:
// A parameter is what a function takes in (generally) when it is declared or defined.
// An argument is the specific data that is passed when the function is called.

//2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
// Console.log logs the data or output of something to the console which isn't necessarily visible on the browser. 
// Return causes the outcome of the function to be rendered to the browser or screen.
